As part of my role in TecEx's Cloud team, I developed this Attachment Tool.

## Application Overview

The attachment tool is a desktop application, which allows a user to upload or download files to the CRM system - Salesforce. In Salesforce, multilpe object types exist which could have files attached to them. Each object can have multiple instances, called records. The Attachment Tool enables a user to transfer large amounts of files between their PC and Salesforce - a process that is extreamly time consuming when carried out manually or file by file.

Excel files are used by the user to specify the details of the file transfer. To download files, the user only specifies the record IDs which attachements they require.  For an upload of files, the user specifies the record ID and the file name they want to upload. Once the user has captured the information, the tool is launched from their desktop.
